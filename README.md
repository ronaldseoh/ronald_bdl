# ronald_bdl

`ronald_bdl` is a Python package containing PyTorch implementation of various NN architectures for my Bayesian deep learning research project, mainly focusing on the [Monte Carlo dropout](https://link.iamblogger.net/bdlpaper) method. My project intends to provide further analysis on the benefits of MC dropout by empirically evaluating its *practicality* and suggesting considerations to be made when applying the method to real-life models.

This repo started with the codes directly copied from [`bayesian-dl-experiments`](https://link.iamblogger.net/bdl-exp). For the older commit histories, please check [here](https://link.iamblogger.net/068qc).
